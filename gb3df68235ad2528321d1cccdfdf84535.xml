  <title>Discuss (U8): Climate Change &amp; the "Disruption" Movie</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your thoughts about the &lt;em&gt;Disruption&lt;/em&gt; movie: &lt;/strong&gt;Please Note - "Community" may refer to your personal community or to the Dominican community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did you think about the movie? Did watching it did it make you feel motivated to make a change, or was the message too biased for your taste? Which issues in the film are most relevant to you and your community? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicate whether you would ever host a viewing of the movie to have discussion or organize other direct steps that you could take (e.g. the movie gives some examples of marches, etc.; and identify existing organizations, allies and campaigns near you.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research, identify and describe some examples of efforts made towards a renewable energy future in your community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Posts are due on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday by 11:59 pm&lt;/strong&gt;, in which you use full sentences and proper grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respond to at least two other students' posts (at a minimum), which are due on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday by 11:59 pm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be sure to respond to other students' posts with a substantive comment using full sentences and proper grammar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hope you've enjoyed the course and feel that you have learned quite a bit more about the earth!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
