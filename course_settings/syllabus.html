<h4>Office Hours: By Appointment</h4>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>This course is designed to provide an overview and basic understanding of Earth Science and its many aspects (e.g. geologic time, plate tectonics, various types of Earth's physical feature,&nbsp; and the various processes at work such as erosion, cycling of water, glaciation, etc.). The course also explore the atmosphere, weather, climate, and climate change. This is an asynchronous online course.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: SPCS 200</strong></p>
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>Successful completion of this course will enable you to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly summarize the roughly 4.5 billion years' worth of Earth's formation, and the evolution of its structure and climate.</li>
<li>Discuss how Earth's current environment is a product of continuous change.</li>
<li>Describe the interactions between Earth's physical features, atmosphere, weather, and climate.</li>
<li>Describe the human impacts to the Earth's physical features, atmosphere, and climate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>About the Instructor</h3>
<p>Joann Dickinson is an Adjunct Instructor in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University.&nbsp; She has been teaching at Dominican since June 2011 in Legal Reasoning, Politics, Earth Science, Environmental Science and law. Dickinson has designed courses in Earth Science, Environmental Science, and Environmental Law; as well as Environmental Politics and Legal Reasoning. She holds a JD from Thomas M. Cooley Law School, a MS in Environmental Science and Policy from University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, and a BS in Environmental Science from Saint Norbert College.</p>
<h3>Textbook &amp; Materials</h3>
<p>During this course, you will be reading various chapters in <em>Earth Science: An Introduction</em> by Marc Hendrix &amp; Graham R. Thompson. It is available to you as an eBook purchase. You will find further details regarding this on the course "Home" page. Any other written materials and videos are made available to you within this course.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to produce original work in this class. Any time you use someone else's words or ideas, you need to give proper attribution. I use plagiarism detection software to scan each assignment submitted. If you plagiarize, you will be caught and punished. The first offense is a zero for the assignment, the second is an automatic F for the course and the third is expulsion from the university. If you have any questions about what constitutes original work, please ask before you turn in your assignment. Additional information on the University's Academic Integrity Policy can be found in the Student Guide.</p>
<h3>Late Work</h3>
<p>Late discussion and writing assignments, and quizzes will be assessed a 10% penalty for each day late - absent extraordinary circumstances. If you know that you will need flexibility with the due date of a particular assignment, please contact the instructor to discuss options <strong>before</strong> the due date is approaching.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Method</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on your participation in the online introduction (2%), 16 unit discussion assignments (48%), 8 brief online quizzes (16%), 6 writing assignments of various point-values (25%) and a Final Exam over previous material (9%). Rubrics for discussion and writing assignments are posted at the end of this syllabus. Quizzes will be open throughout the week and can be re-taken as often as you like up until the end of the unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is a breakdown of how your grade will be calculated:</strong></p>

<h3>Course Expectations</h3>
<p>Class participation is an essential aspect of this and any other course regardless of whether it is fully online, hybrid or face-to-face. As this course is an online-only course provided at an accelerated pace as an 8-week course, it is essential that students make their initial posts for discussion assignments by Wednesday at 11:59pm for each unit. Your classmates need time to see and respond to your initial posts; and you need to be able to see the initial posts of others, in order to provide the required numbers of responses to other students' posts by Sunday at 11:59pm. For those of you that like to get an early start on assignments, assignments will be made available at 8:00am on the Thursday prior to the start of a particular unit. The units will be gated. In other words, each unit will be turned on and made available to you on the Thursday just prior to the start of that particular unit. If you wish to see an overview of the topics and work you will be completing for this course, consult this syllabus for a list of assignments and due dates; and at the bottom of the course "Home" page, you will see a list of the units included in this course. Click on all or all of them to see a brief description of the unit, the unit objectives, and the "Start Here" link for beginning each unit as it is made available to you. Please Note: You may not move on to the next unit unless the previous unit has been completed.</p>
<h3>Course Climate</h3>
<p>All members of the Dominican community are entitled to respect. You should always address your classmates and instructor professionally in face-to-face and online environments; and in all of your digital communications. The ability to express disagreement while maintaining civility is a critical skill and it will serve you well long after you graduate. A student who behaves in such a way as to disrupt the learning environment of his or her classmates will be immediately removed from the course. If you feel you are not being treated respectfully, please speak with your instructor or academic advisor.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accommodations for Disabilities</h3>
<p>The Dean of Students Office is a university resource promoting barrier-free environments (e.g. physical, program, information, attitude) and assisting the university in meeting its obligations under federal statutes and school tradition in regard to the rights of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Office of the Dean of Students coordinates the provision of services necessary and appropriate for students with special needs. Upon receipt of appropriate documentation of disability, this office assists by providing or arranging appropriate auxiliary aids and services, reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments, and consultation. In some instances, the Dean of Students Office acts as a liaison with other appropriate state and federal agencies.</p>
<p>Students are expected to meet individually with the Dean of Students to determine what specific services and reasonable accommodations are needed. It is the responsibility of the student to make requests for auxiliary aids or special services at least three weeks prior to the start of a program or class. If you have any questions or problems arising out of this policy, please do not hesitate to contact me for a confidential discussion of your options.</p>
<h3>Course Evaluation</h3>
<p>Near the end of the semester, you will be asked to evaluate this course in an anonymous online form on MyDU. Participating in the course evaluation is an important aspect of being a member of the Dominican community. We all, students and instructors alike, rely on feedback so that we might grow and improve. Dominican instructors are always looking for ways to improve student learning and we can't do it without your feedback and comments. Since the course evaluation is digital and online, it may be completed at your convenience, outside of class. Although it is accessed using your Dominican username, responses are anonymous. Course instructors are not provided access to their course evaluation reports until after final course grades have been submitted to the Registrar's Office, so you should feel confident in providing candid feedback - knowing that your evaluation will not affect your course grade.</p>
<h3>Class Schedule (assignments and dates subject to change)</h3>
<p>For each unit, there are posted reading assignments corresponding to chapters in the text. For each unit, there will be a number of assignments due. Generally, there will be a quiz, two discussion assignments, and a writing assignment due for each unit. Please review the class schedule (below) for further details. There is also a Final Exam due at the end of the last week of class. The final consists of questions you have seen before on the homework assignments. It is worth 80 points.</p>
