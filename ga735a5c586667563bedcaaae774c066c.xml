  <title>Discuss (U5): The Great Lakes</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;Living in the Great Lakes Region, we are most fortunate that we have access to one of the largest bodies of accessible fresh water in the world. The Great Lakes are an international resource shared between the U.S., Canada and Native American Tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given worldwide issues with water access:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull from this weeks resources and explain whether you think The Great Lakes are in danger of diminishing due to decreased precipitation and/or overuse (e.g. possibly from selling water rights to other areas)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
