&lt;p&gt;Thanks for dropping by the Student Lounge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a space to stop by and ask a questions of your fellow students or the instructor. Questions can range from something that sparked a thought in the material to non-academic or even things not directly related to course content. This space is yours, so make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Good example student lounge questions:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I know someone told me at some point how to get my DU ID, but I forgot how to get it, where to go and if it costs anything. Can anyone help me out please?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I am struggling with writing my papers in APA style. Does anyone have any suggested internet sites that I could look up to improve my understanding of APA guidelines? Thanks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Maybe not a good student lounge question:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dear Professor, why did I get a C- on my last paper? I think everyone else got an A, so why did I get a C-? (This should be reserved for a private conversation between the instructor and the student.)&lt;/li&gt;
