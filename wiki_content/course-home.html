<h3>Welcome to SPCS 302 - Earth and Its Processes!</h3>
<p><strong>Earth and Its Processes</strong> is an introductory course to Earth Science. It is designed to provide an overview and basic understanding of Earth Science and its many aspects (e.g. geologic time, plate tectonics, various types of Earth's physical features), and the various processes at work such as erosion, cycling of water, glaciation, etc.. The course also explores the atmosphere, weather, climate, and climate change.</p>
<p>Please review the course syllabus by clicking its link in the course navigation menu. There is one required textbook for this course. See access information below. All materials, including the textbook, are accessible within Canvas. If any links aren't working, please let me know as soon as possible so I can fix them.</p>

<h2 class="du-icon-objectives">What Will I Learn?</h2>
<p><strong>Successful completion of this course will enable you to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize the roughly 4.5 billion years' worth of Earth's formation and evolution of its structure and climate.</li>
<li>Discuss how Earth's current environment is a product of continuous change.</li>
<li>Describe the interactions between Earth's physical features, atmosphere, weather, and climate.</li>
<li>Describe the human impacts to the Earth's physical features, atmosphere, and climate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="du-icon-format">Course Format</h2>
<p>This is an asynchronous course. This format provides a great deal of freedom for students to adopt study practices that work best for them. From experience, we can say that students will, on average, devote approximately 8–10 hours per week to this course. Your workload may vary somewhat from week to week and from student to student depending on prior experience, the nature of the topic being studied, and other factors.</p>
<p>This course is being delivered on Canvas and is organized into eight units. In each unit, you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigned readings and videos</li>
<li>Discussion prompts, which require posting on this schedule: Make an initial post in each discussion by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m.; make required responses to others by Sunday at 11:59 p.m.</li>
<li>Quizzes</li>
<li>Writing assignments (Only some weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some units are busier than others, so be sure to review each module carefully so you can plan your workload for the week.</p>
