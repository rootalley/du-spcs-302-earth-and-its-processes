  <title>Discuss (U6): Deserts</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, so deserts are dry! &lt;/strong&gt;People often have one picture in their mind of what a desert looks like. There often are similarities. However, once you have experienced more than one, you discover that they are not all alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion is going to be more of an open discussion; and I will chime in a few times in this thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on the reading, describe what you found to be most interesting about deserts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and describe at least two desert areas in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have experienced a desert, please share a description of what you observed and experienced; and identify the location.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial posts are due on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday by 11:59 pm&lt;/strong&gt;, in which you use full sentences and proper grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respond to at least two other students' posts (at a minimum), which are due on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday by 11:59 pm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be sure to respond to other students' posts with a substantive comment using full sentences and proper grammar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
